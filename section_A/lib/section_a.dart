//qn1.(a) flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by google.
//Types of applications are:
//-Moblile Application like(iOS and Android)
//-Web Application
//-Desktop Application(linux,etc)

//(b)Advantages of using Flutter
//-Cross platform development:developers build a single codebase which is used on both iOS and Android
//- Faster development with hot reload
//-

//(c) Dart programming: is simply the Object_Oriented,class-based progamming languege developed by google
// why Dart is used with Flutter:
//-it helps in faster development since it supports Hot reload where developer see changes in code instandly
//-its also Wigdet Friendly,where it works seamlessly with flutter widgets
//-its also does cross platform development where applied its codebase is used in various development .

//(d)Hot Reloed in Flutter: is a feature in flutter that enables the developer to see the code changes immediatly 
//in a running application without restarting-
// How it  improves the user productivity
//-

//(f)Statless widget is a widget build based on its own configuration and does not change dymanically
//Example of a stateless widget is where an image and its Description is displayed on a screen and doesnt change
//While

//Stateful widget is a widget buid based on its own configuration but changes dynamically
//Example is where an icon and its description are displayed and there can be change of values

//(g)Dart function is below
//        void main(){
       //      int a = 5;
       //      int b = 4;
       //      int sum = a + b;
       //       print('The sum is $sum');}

       //(h)

       //(i)Dart program that demostrates the mapping is below

       //          void main(){
               //       Map<String, String> names = {
                //           'first_name': 'Alice';
                //            'second_name': 'Aaron';
                //            'third_name':  'millia';
                //          

        //             };
        //                  print(names);
       //        }
